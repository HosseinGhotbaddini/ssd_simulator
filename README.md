This is a flash-based page-mapping SSD simulator, which gets a block trace log file and relevant configs as input and outputs the desired statistics. It is authored by Hoaran Liu and Hossein Ghotbaddini in Dec 2021 as the course project for Topics in Storage Systems course (CSC2233) at the University of Toronto (Instructor - Prof. Bianca Schroeder).
